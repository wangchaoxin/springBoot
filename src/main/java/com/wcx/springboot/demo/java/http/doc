5. Timeout Properties Explained
Now, let’s explain what these various types of timeouts mean:

the Connection Timeout (http.connection.timeout) – the time to establish the connection with the remote host
the Socket Timeout (http.socket.timeout) – the time waiting for data – after the connection was established; maximum time of inactivity between two data packets
the Connection Manager Timeout (http.connection-manager.timeout) – the time to wait for a connection from the connection manager/pool
The first two parameters – the connection and socket timeouts – are the most important, but setting a timeout for obtaining a connection is definitely important in high load scenarios, which is why the third parameter shouldn’t be ignored.
